        "Preserve the face from the uploaded image. An ultra-sharp 8K studio portrait of an elegant and sophisticated East Asian bride. She sits gracefully with a gentle side tilt, her expression calm and serene, exuding refined elegance and artistic charm. She wears a strapless white ball gown made of high-quality satin, delicately pleated and spreading widely around her. She wears no tiara, keeping the look minimalist and modern. Her long black hair is neatly styled in a low bun, revealing her facial features and creating a pure, graceful impression. The background is a bright, minimalist white studio, featuring a classical Greek sculpture and a golden picture frame beside her, adding an artistic and luxurious touch. Strong white light shines from the side, casting soft shadows and well-defined contours that highlight the texture of the satin gown and the curves of her face. The overall mood is elegant, artistic, refined, and poetic. The style reflects fine art wedding photography — a harmoni"

        "Ultra-photorealistic cinematic portrait, 8K sharpness, vertical 9:16. Preserve the exact face identity from the uploaded reference photo — 100% locked facial structure. A beautiful young East Asian woman with fair skin, serene expression, and eyes gently closed, a delicate red bindi on her forehead. Her dark brown hair is elaborately styled into a high bun with intricate braids, adorned with delicate silver chain headpieces and small floral pins. She wears subtle peach-toned makeup with soft lips. She is wearing a flowing, traditional Chinese/fantasy-inspired outfit. The top is a black sheer V-neck crop top with wide, translucent bell sleeves (featuring light beige/cream sections) and golden butterfly appliques and intricate gold web-like embroidery on the bodice. Her high-waisted skirt has a golden inner layer with elaborate patterns, covered by a sheer, light grey/silver tulle outer layer. A black and gold patterned belt with a black ribbon bow and white and black tassels cinches her waist. She wears multiple delicate silver necklaces and long black tassel earrings. A white folding fan with intricate red floral designs rests on the moss-covered log beside her. In a lush, verdant forest. The background features deep green foliage with a soft, dreamy bokeh effect. She is standing near the log, holding the white folding fan open partially in front of her face, obscuring her eyes, a hint of her serene expression visible. Head and shoulders shot, portrait orientation. Soft, warm, diffused golden hour sunlight filtering through the trees, creating a gentle backlit glow around her hair and shoulders, illuminating her face softly. Ethereal, mystical, tranquil, fine art portraiture, cinematic, fantasy fashion aesthetic."
