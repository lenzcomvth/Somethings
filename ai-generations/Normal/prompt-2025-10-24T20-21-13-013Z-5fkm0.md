      "enhancement_goal": "Generate an ultra-photorealistic 8K HDR cinematic image with enhanced sensual appeal, lifelike hair physics, and precise lighting realism."
    },
    "concept": "A hyperrealistic commercial-style image of a confident, sensual Vietnamese woman posing beside a pink Lamborghini supercar under natural daylight — exuding charm, elegance, and premium summer allure. The composition blends high-fashion sensuality with automotive luxury and cinematic realism.",
    "character": {
      "ethnicity": "Vietnamese (Southeast Asian tone)",
      "gender": "female",
      "face": "Delicately photorealistic Vietnamese facial structure with luminous skin, slightly parted glossy lips, subtle blush glow, long lashes, and a warm inviting gaze. Makeup highlights cheekbones and emphasizes sensual femininity without exaggeration.",
      "hair": "Extremely long light-purple wavy hair cascading past the waist, styled in voluminous flowing curls with natural movement and depth. Strands shimmer with multi-tone violet highlights under sunlight, reflecting soft golden light from the car. Fine flyaway strands flow dynamically in the breeze, rendered with cinematic strand-level scattering and wind motion simulation, creating a sense of graceful energy.",
      "body": "Athletic yet feminine with refined curvature — slender waist, toned abdomen, accentuated hips, and long legs. Subtle wet sheen enhances the definition of muscle lines and skin smoothness. Natural posing posture emphasizing sensual poise and confidence.",
      "skin": "Sun-kissed luminous tone with soft natural gradients; micro-water droplets and reflective moisture on collarbones, abdomen, and thighs. Subsurface scattering under HDR light produces lifelike translucency and touchable realism.",
      "expression": "Confident, seductive, and graceful — lips slightly parted as if breathing in the summer air; eyes focused on the viewer with a subtle half-smile blending power and allure.",
      "pose": "Leaning elegantly against the Lamborghini’s fender, one leg subtly crossed in front of the other to accentuate body curves; one hand lifting hair strands in the breeze, the other resting on the car door. Pose designed to project a sense of cinematic sensuality and elegance simultaneously."
    },
    "clothing": {
      "outfit": "Luxury two-piece bikini in deep royal blue (British flag blue), designed with minimal lines and soft contours that emphasize natural body curves. The top has delicate metallic accents reflecting the sunlight, and the fabric clings naturally to the wet skin surface for hyper-realistic texture.",
      "material_detail": "Wet reflective fabric shader with micro-fiber realism; anisotropic highlights under sunlight; natural wrinkle flow conforming to body movement.",
      "style": "Premium swimwear editorial aesthetic — bold yet sophisticated, exuding elegance through subtle sensual expression rather than exposure.",
      "accessories": "No jewelry; optional transparent water bottle on car hood; focus entirely on physique, reflections, and light-skin interaction."

      "angle": "Low-angle three-quarter cinematic view emphasizing leg length and car geometry.",
      "lens": "85mm f/1.4 full-frame portrait lens for elegant compression and creamy background bokeh.",
      "depth_of_field": "Shallow DOF; perfect optical separation between model and car background.",
      "focus": "Ultra-sharp focus on face, bikini fabric, and wet highlights; gradual falloff across the car rear.",
      "composition": "Golden-ratio alignment; diagonal car line leads eye toward subject; background softened for cinematic depth.",
      "render_target": "8K HDR tone-mapped output with path-traced reflections and optical fidelity."
    },
    "style": {
      "art_direction": "High-fashion commercial realism with elevated sensual tone — luxurious yet tasteful, designed for premium editorial presentation.",
      "visual_quality": "Physically accurate material rendering, volumetric softness, global illumination with skin translucency and high-fidelity texture mapping.",
      "aesthetic": "Elegant sensuality; focus on realism, beauty, and cinematic intimacy.",
      "tones": "Harmonious contrast between pink car, royal-blue bikini, violet hair, and golden skin — unified under soft daylight."
    },
    "color_palette": {
      "primary": "Royal blue bikini, pink Lamborghini, light-violet hair, golden skin tone.",
